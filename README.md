Data Vis Project Topic and Data Set
For this semester's Data Visualisation Project, you will work in a small team to research, design and build an interactive data visualisation for a website. The website is to be hosted on Vercel.

Project Brief
The Bureau of Infrastructure and Transport Research Economics (BITRE) has been publishing Australian transport statistics since 1970.  Their data collection on road safety enforcement data (e.g., fines for mobile phone use, speeding etc and drug testing) goes back to 2008. However, in 2023 they started collecting more fine grained detail about road safety enforcement. (e.g., location, age group, arrests and charges).

Unfortunately their current Police Enforcement Dashboard does not take into account the new level of detail. For this project you will design and implement one or more interactive visualisations that:

allow users to explore selected parts of this data,
tells a story about some aspect of this data.
